Running genPhotonStatistics.py simulates the photon probabilities and saves the results in a .npz file, with the file name encoding the simulation parameters.
utilities_LLR.py contains functions for log-likelihood ratio-based contrast extraction, emphasizing the use of recursive equations.
LLR_demonstration.ipynb provides an example of contrast extraction using the generated .npz file and the functions from utilities_LLR.py.
